                        <p><b>Application Introduction:</b></p>
                        
                        <p>The application in question is a sophisticated banking management system designed with
                                object-oriented programming
                                principles. It serves as a practical illustration of how software can manage and track
                                financial information in a
                                user-friendly and efficient manner.</p>
                        <p>At its heart, the system revolves around a PersonRegister, which is essentially a database of
                                individuals (or
                                "Persons"). Each person within this register can own multiple bank accounts, but with an
                                important constraint: no
                                individual is allowed to hold more than three accounts. This rule, along with others
                                such as age restrictions (minimum
                                age of 18 for account ownership) and withdrawal limits (maximum of 50% of the account
                                balance at a time), ensures
                                responsible financial management and adherence to standard banking practices.</p>
                        <p>What makes this application particularly user-friendly is its Graphical User Interface (GUI),
                                built using
                                JavaFX. The GUI makes it easy for users to interact with the system, whether itâ€™s for
                                adding new data, managing existing
                                accounts, or viewing comprehensive financial summaries. The interface is designed to be
                                intuitive, ensuring that users
                                can navigate through various functionalities without facing complexities.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the application is built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
                                This separation of concerns
                                not only makes the application more manageable from a development standpoint but also
                                enhances its scalability and
                                maintainability. For instance, modifications in the database structure (the Model) can
                                be made independently of changes
                                in the GUI (the View).</p>
                        <p>In summary, this application is a robust, user-centric tool for managing a banking register.
                                It combines the principles
                                of object-oriented programming with a focus on user experience and software design
                                patterns, making it a comprehensive
                                solution for both demonstrating programming proficiency and serving real-world banking
                                management needs.</p>

                        <p>In my JavaFX application, I implemented an "Add Person" feature which allows users to input
                                and register a person's
                                details into a system. The user interface consists of three text fields for entering an
                                identification number, name, and
                                age. This feature is designed to ensure that no field is left blank, prompting users to
                                complete all sections before
                                proceeding. If the age input is not a positive number, the application notifies the user
                                to correct the entry. This
                                preventative measure ensures data integrity and enhances user experience by providing
                                immediate feedback.</p>
                        <p>Upon successful validation of input data, the application creates a new Person object and
                                integrates it into the
                                system's backend through both a personRegister and an observablePersonList. The latter
                                ensures that any changes are
                                reflected in real-time within the application's user interface, such as updating a table
                                view. Once the person is added,
                                the application confirms the successful operation to the user and clears the input
                                fields, readying the form for the
                                next entry. This feature showcases thoughtful application flow and user-friendly design,
                                providing an efficient and
                                error-resistant process for managing personal data entries.</p>
                        <p><b>Application Spotlight: Add Account</b></p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>In the JavaFX application I've been developing, I crafted a feature called "Add Account" that
                                facilitates users in
                                adding banking account details for registered individuals. The user interface for this
                                feature is comprised of three
                                input fields: one for the account holder's identification number, one for the account
                                number, and one for the initial
                                balance. This setup is meticulously designed to prevent any oversight in data entry,
                                ensuring that all fields are
                                properly filled out before submission. Should there be any formatting errors in the
                                initial balance field, the
                                application prompts the user to rectify the input, preserving the integrity of the
                                financial data.</p>
                        <p>When the input data passes all validations, the application proceeds to look up the person
                                associated with the given
                                identification number. It checks that the person exists and is of legal age to hold an
                                account. It also ensures that the
                                person does not exceed the maximum limit of three accounts, adhering to our banking
                                policy. If these conditions are met,
                                a new BankAccount object is instantiated with the provided details and linked to the
                                person's record. This update is
                                immediately reflected in the user interface via an observable list, which in turn
                                refreshes the TableView to display the
                                latest information. A confirmation message is displayed, and the input fields are
                                cleared, making the interface ready
                                for the next transaction. This feature embodies a seamless and user-centric design,
                                optimizing the workflow for account
                                management within the banking application.

                        <hr>
                        <p>In my JavaFX application, I have developed two crucial features for managing banking
                                transactions: "Withdraw" and
                                "Deposit". These features allow users to perform financial transactions on specific
                                accounts within the banking system.</p>
                        <p><b>Withdraw & Deposit Feature: </b></p>
                        <p>
                                In my JavaFX application, the "Withdraw" and "Deposit" features enable efficient account
                                management. For withdrawals, it
                                checks if the account number is entered and validates the withdrawal amount, ensuring
                                it's positive and not exceeding
                                half the account's balance. If valid, the transaction is processed, updating the balance
                                and the TableView. The
                                "Deposit" function similarly verifies the account number and ensures a positive deposit
                                amount. It updates the account
                                balance upon successful validation, with errors in either process prompting a customer
                                service contact. These features
                                demonstrate rigorous input validation, error handling, and real-time updates, essential
                                for a robust financial
                                application..</p>
                        <p><b>Deposit Feature: </b></p>
                        <p>
                                Similarly, the "Deposit" feature involves inputting an account number and a deposit
                                amount. The code verifies that the
                                account number is provided and the amount is a valid, positive double. It locates the
                                specified account in the system;
                                if the account doesn't exist, it notifies the user. Upon successful validation, the
                                deposit is processed. The account's
                                balance is updated and displayed, and the TableView is refreshed to show the latest
                                information. Like the withdrawal
                                feature, any errors encountered during the deposit process result in a prompt to contact
                                customer service.

                                Both features are designed to enhance the banking application's functionality, enabling
                                users to manage their accounts
                                efficiently and securely. They demonstrate careful input validation, error handling, and
                                real-time data updating, key
                                aspects of a robust financial application.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>In my JavaFX application, the <i>handleButtonTotalBalanceAction</i> feature is designed to
                                calculate and
                                display the total balance of all accounts associated with a specific person. When
                                activated, it retrieves the
                                person's identification number, computes the total balance across their accounts, and
                                presents this information
                                in a text field for easy viewing.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <p>The <i>handleButtonDisplayAccountInfoAction</i> feature enhances user interaction by opening
                                a new window
                                where users can input a person's identification number. This action triggers the
                                <i>displayAccountInfo</i> method, which fetches and displays detailed information about
                                the person's
                                bank accounts, such as account IDs and balances, in a pop-up window format.
                        </p>
                        <hr>

                        <p>With the <i>handleButtonPrintAllPersonsInfoAction</i> method, the application provides a
                                comprehensive
                                overview of all registered persons. It iterates through each individual in the person
                                register, compiles their
                                personal and account balance information, and displays it, offering a complete summary
                                of all persons in the
                                system.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>The <i>handleButtonShowTotalBalanceAllAccountsAction</i> method is a crucial feature that
                                calculates and
                                exhibits the cumulative balance of all accounts managed by the system. This macro-level
                                functionality offers a
                                quick snapshot of the total funds under the bank's management, reflecting the
                                application's broader financial
                                scope.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Additionally, the <i>setPersonRegister</i> and <i>displayAccountInfo</i> functions serve as
                                supportive utilities. <i>setPersonRegister</i> is used for initializing or updating the
                                <code>personRegister</code> object, while <i>displayAccountInfo</i> is crucial for
                                rendering a
                                specific person's bank account information as part of the user interface.

                        <hr>
                        <p>Overall, these features collectively augment the banking application, providing an efficient
                                and user-friendly
                                platform for managing and displaying critical financial information. They showcase the
                                system's ability to
                                handle a range of user queries, from individual account details to aggregated financial
                                statistics.</p>
