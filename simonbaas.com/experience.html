                <strong>Title:</strong> Research Translator<br>
                <strong>Company:</strong> Lund University · Part-Time<br>
                <strong>Date:</strong> November 2023 – Present<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Lund University, Sweden<br><br>
                
                In November 2023, I embarked on a challenging yet fulfilling journey as a part-time Research Translator at Lund
                University, a renowned institution in Sweden known for its exemplary research and educational standards. My role
                primarily involved creating accurate and coherent translations from Swedish to English, catering to various research
                projects within the university. One of the notable tasks I undertook was the translation of sensitive interview
                transcripts, a substantial project encompassing over 100,000 words. This required not only linguistic skills but
                also a keen understanding of the subject matter to maintain the essence of the original material. My commitment to
                ensuring consistency between the source and translated content significantly contributed to a 25% increase in team
                productivity within just a month. This experience has been instrumental in honing my translation skills, deepening
                my understanding of academic subjects, and enhancing my ability to work effectively in a fast-paced, intellectually
                stimulating environment.
